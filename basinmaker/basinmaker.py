        make are to add new POI sites, remove existing POI sites, or modify
        the location of existing POI sites in the input routing network. 
        This function will use the location of the provided POI and link 
        them to the subbasins in the routing network. At least one POI 
        should be provided in the point shapefile. 

        Parameters
        ----------
        path_output_folder                   : string
            is the folder path that stores generated outputs
        routing_product_folder         : string
            is the folder path where the input hydrologic routing network is stored
        path_to_points_of_interest_points                : string
            is the path to the point shapefile that contains the point of interest (POI) sites. 
            The shapefile must have an attribute table that includes the following columns:

              - Obs_NM (string): This column should contain the name or ID of the POI site. 
                When the provided POI has the same Obs_NM as the existing POI in the routing
                product, this function will assume that the user wants to relocate the existing 
                POI. Otherwise, the clean_exist_pois variable below controls whether the new POI 
                sites fully replace existing POI sites or augment the existing POI sites.

              - DA_Obs (float): This column should contain the drainage area of the POI site.

              - SRC_obs (string): This column should contain the source of the POI site.

              - Type (string): This column should contain the type of the POI site. Each POI 
                can only have one type. The following types are currently supported: "Lake": the 
                POI is located on a lake waterbody surface. "River": the POI is located on a 
                river channel. Note that the "Lake" type POI should be located within a lake 
                subbasin and the "River" type POI should be located within a non-lake subbasin. 
                The POI located in the wrong subbasin will be ignored and not added to the routing 
                product. The âRiverâ type POI will be linked to a non-lake subbasin that contains 
                the POI. The âLakeâ type POI will be linked to the lake subbasin that contains the POI. 

        gis_platform                   : string
            is the parameter indicating which gis platform is used. Currenly, only "purepy" 
            is allowed for this parameter.
        clean_exist_pois                : boolean
            Indicates if the user wants to remove all existing POI in the input routing product. 
            When it is true, all existing POI will be removed, and only the POI sites provided in
            the path_to_points_of_interest_points will be added to the input routing network. 

        Returns
        -------

        Notes
        -----
        This function does not return any values. If the user only wants to add POI to the routing 
        product, they should set clean_exist_pois to False. This will keep the existing POI and 
        add the provided POI to the routing product. If the user wants to remove all existing POI 
        and add new POI, they should set clean_exist_pois to True. This will remove all existing 
        POI from the routing product and then add the provided POI to the routing product. 
        The modified hydrological routing network will be generated in the path_output_folder 
        and will include the following files:

            is the path to a raster elevation dataset, that is used to

            It is a list of HRU area thresthold for landuse, soil and other_1 layer respectively. In BasinMaker HRU calculation, each layer will firstly be overlaid to the subbasin map. Attributes falling into each subbasin with their area ratios (i.e., the intersected area to the subbasin area) smaller than the defined threshold values will then be dissolved into the largest part. For example, if forest area ratio in a subbasin, say subbasin #10, is 0.05, while we set the area threshold for land cover is 0.1. The forest polygons will then be dissolved to the largest land cover type in subbasin #10.

            system to projected_epsg_code. If the routing network generated by
            basinmaker is under a geographic system, please use EPSG code from
            any projected system. The coordinate system of routing network from

            is a path of the polyline shapefile that contains bankfull width (w) and

            w= 7.2 Q**0.5 and d=0.27Q**0.39 , respectively. And the the bankfull
            discharge Q of each subbasin can be estimated using the relationship
